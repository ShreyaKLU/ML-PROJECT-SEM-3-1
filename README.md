# ML-PROJECT-SEM-3-1
ML project based on recognizing the car number  from given image

ANPR is an image-processing technology which is used to identify
vehicles by their number plates using Optical Character
Recognition.


 This technology is used in various security and traffic applications
such as access-control system.


 Automatic Number Plate Recognition (or 'number plate
recognition') is a special form of optical character recognition
(OCR).


 It enables computer systems to read automatically the registration
number (license number) of vehicles from digital pictures.


 Reading automatically the registration number means
transforming the pixels of the digital image into the ASCII text of
the number plate.


 OCR technology scans paper documents and turn them into
electronic, editable files. Capturing of fast moving vehicles needs
special technique to avoid motion blur . To ensure the right image
quality short shutter time is used with high-power illumination.
